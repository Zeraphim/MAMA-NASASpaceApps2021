# Monitoring and Assessing Marine Debris Application (M.A.M.A) - Hydronautics Team

## 💡 What we're about 💡

MAMA (Monitoring and Assessing Marine Debris Application) uses Mapbox API to display heatmaps in ocean bodies with high concentration of marine debris. The data is extracted from sattelite images which is then used by the application to provide heatmaps in their corresponding coordinates in the water bodies.
